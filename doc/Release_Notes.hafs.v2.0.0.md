### 1. Background:

Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), as the Unified Forecast System
(UFS) hurricane application, is the FV3 (FiniteÂ­ Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical
Core) based multi-scale model and data assimilation system capable of providing
tropical cyclone (TC, including hurricane and typhoon) analyses and forecasts
of the inner core structure key to improving storm size and intensity
predictions, as well as the large-scale environment that is known to influence
the TC's motion. The HAFS development targets an operational data
assimilation and modeling system, capable of providing reliable, robust and
skillful model guidances for TC track, intensity (including rapid
intensification), size, structure, rainfall and cyclone genesis, as well as for
TC associated storm surge, sea surface waves, and tornadoes. HAFS is a
community-based coupled earth modeling system specially calibrated for
hurricane prediction with TC dynamics and physics, sophisticated vortex
initialization and advanced inner-core data assimilation techniques, and
various air-sea interaction processes.

HAFSv2 will replace NCEP's current operational hurricane forecast systems,
HAFSv1 in the 2024 hurricane season. The goal of this project is to upgrade the
HAFSv1 that was running in operations in 2023. The system will provide improved
and comparable tropical cyclone track and intensity forecast guidance in all
global oceanic basins, as demonstrated through evaluation of retrospective and
real time experiments compared against the two current configurations of
operational HFSAv1 and HFSBv1.

     - `./scripts/exhafs_obs_prep.sh`: to decode/dump TDR/HDOB/TEMPDROP data
     - `./scripts/exhafs_msg_check.py`: to check the message files are properly created by checking the original NHC/JTWC message files in the DCOM directory.
     - `./ush/setup_hurricane`: for SDM to set up hurricane message files by extracting info from the original NHC/JTWC message files in the DCOM directory.
