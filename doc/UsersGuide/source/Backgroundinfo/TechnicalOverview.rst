Technical Overview
*******************

This chapter contains an overview of HAFS prerequisites, HAFS repository management and structure, workflow design, and HAFS |latestr| operational updates.

.. _Prerequisites:

===================================================
Prerequisites for Working with the HAFS Repository
===================================================

* Git version 1.8.2 or newer, which added the possibility to track branches of submodules. The following versions of Git are used on NOAA HPCs: 

  * **Orion**: 

    * Git version 1.8.3.1 (system default)
    * Git version 2.21.0 (available via ``module load git/2.21.0``)

  * **Jet/Hera**: Git version 2.18.0
  * **WCOSS Dell**: Git version 1.8.3.1
  * **WCOSS Cray** (cannot access GitHub)

    * Git version 1.7.12.4 (system default) 
    * Git version 2.14.2 (available)

      * ``module use /gpfs/hps3/emc/hwrf/noscrub/soft/modulefiles``
      * ``module load git/2.14.2``

* `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ account (e.g., FirstLast-NOAA)

.. _RepositoryManagement:

==================================
HAFS GitHub Repository Management
==================================

The authoritative HAFS repository is publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/hafs-community/HAFS. 
It is maintained by EMC and DTC with developments and contributions from the :term:`UFS` HAFS application team and the hurricane research community.

**HAFS Branching/Tagging Conventions:**

  - ``develop``: The main development branch
  - ``support/[name]``: Branches used by operational implementations or HFIP real-time parallel experiments (e.g., ``support/hafs.v0.2.0``)
  - ``release/vx.x.x``: Public release branches (e.g., ``release/v1.0.0``)
  - ``[name].v#.#.#`` (*tags*): hafs.v0.2.0, hafs.v1.0.0, public.v1.0.0, etc.
  - ``hotfix/[name]``: Temporary bug fix branches
  - ``feature/[name]``: Feature branches for adding new capabilities or enhancements

The HAFS repository only hosts major feature branches (e.g., ``feature/hafs_nesting``) that require active group collaborations. Individual developers can work on feature branches in their personal HAFS forks.

.. _OperationalUpdates:

===============================
HAFS v2.0.0 Operational Updates 
===============================

**Model:** Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS)

**Version:** hafs.v2.0.0

**Released:** July 01, 2024, 1200UTC

**Location on GitHub:** `HAFS GitHub Repository <https://github.com/hafs-community/HAFS/tree/production/hafs.v2>`_

**Clone the repository:**

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone -b production/hafs.v2 --recursive  https://github.com/hafs-community/HAFS.git

.. attention::
   HAFSv2 runs in production on WCOSS2; pre-implementation testing was performed on Hera and Orion. It is likely possible to run on other systems, but additional code modifications may be required to run an experiment, and this capability has not yet been tested.

**Purpose:**
* The :term:`HFSA` configuration provides hurricane track and intensity forecast guidance to 5.25 days over all global oceanic basins, including :term:`NATL`, :term:`EPAC`, :term:`CPAC`, :term:`WPAC`, :term:`NIO`, and :term:`SH` basins. 
* The :term:`HFSB` configuration provides hurricane track and intensity forecast guidance for 5.25 days over :term:`NHC`/:term:`CPHC` basins, including :term:`NATL`, :term:`EPAC`, :term:`CPAC` basins.


**Developed by:**
    EMC and the UFS Hurricane Application Team. See active HAFSv2 developers in :numref:`Table %s <HAFSDevs>`.

Input/Output
------------

**Input Data:**
    - Global Forecast System (GFS, including GFS/GDAS) :term:`NetCDF` format analysis for atmospheric initial conditions and 3-hourly :term:`GRIB2` files (up to 129 h) for atmospheric lateral boundary conditions and atmospheric forcing for oceanic and wave model components.
    - Global :term:`RTOFS` for oceanic initial and boundary conditions for :term:`MOM6` and :term:`HYCOM`.
    - GFS/GDAS global wave analysis/forecast for :term:`HFSA` wave component initial and lateral boundary conditions.
    - :term:`OBSPROC` observational data for HAFS data assimilation.


**Input DCOM Dependencies**
- The following scripts require input files from DCOM (data input) directory:
    - ``./scripts/exhafs_obs_prep.sh``: To decode/dump TDR/HDOB/TEMPDROP data
    - ``./scripts/exhafs_msg_check.py``: To check the message files are properly created by checking the original NHC/JTWC message files in the DCOM directory.
    - ``./ush/setup_hurricane``: For SDM to set up hurricane message files by extracting info from the original NHC/JTWC message files in the DCOM directory.

**Output:**
    - ATCF track forecast files, 4x/day at 00Z/06Z/12Z/18Z

Background
----------

HAFSv2 will replace NCEP's current operational hurricane forecast systems, HAFSv1 in the 2024 hurricane season. The goal of this project is to upgrade the HAFSv1 that was running in operations in 2023. The system will provide improved and comparable tropical cyclone track and intensity forecast guidance in all global oceanic basins, as demonstrated through evaluation of retrospective and real time experiments compared against the two current configurations of operational HFSAv1 and HFSBv1.

Dissemination and Archiving
---------------------------

**Dissemination Information:**
Files were disseminated as follows:
    - ATCF files to NHC (and CPHC for Central Pacific Basin storms) and JTWC (for all global basins, including SH basins), 
    - GRIB files to NOMADS
    - GEMPAK files to MAG

All the files in the :term:`COM` directory should be transferred from PROD WCOSS2 to DEV WCOSS2. None of the code is proprietary, and there is no restricted data.

**Archive to HPSS:**
All the files in the :term:`COM` directory are preferred to be archived in 5-year retention :term:`HPSS` directory.
