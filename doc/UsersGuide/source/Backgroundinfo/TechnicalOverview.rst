This chapter contains an overview of HAFS prerequisites, HAFS repository management and structure, workflow design, and HAFS v2.0.0 operational updates.

.. _Prerequisites:

===================================================
Prerequisites for Working with the HAFS Repository

      * ``module load git/2.14.2``

* `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ account (e.g., FirstLast-NOAA)

.. _RepositoryManagement:

==================================
HAFS GitHub Repository Management
==================================

The authoritative HAFS repository is publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/hafs-community/HAFS. 
It is maintained by EMC and DTC with developments and contributions from the :term:`UFS` HAFS application team and the hurricane research community.

**HAFS Branching/Tagging Conventions:**

  - ``develop``: The main development branch
  - ``support/[name]``: Branches used by operational implementations or HFIP real-time parallel experiments (e.g., ``support/hafs.v0.2.0``)
  - ``release/vx.x.x``: Public release branches (e.g., ``release/v1.0.0``)
  - ``[name].v#.#.#`` (*tags*): hafs.v0.2.0, hafs.v1.0.0, public.v1.0.0, etc.
  - ``hotfix/[name]``: Temporary bug fix branches
  - ``feature/[name]``: Feature branches for adding new capabilities or enhancements

The HAFS repository only hosts major feature branches (e.g., ``feature/hafs_nesting``) that require active group collaborations. Individual developers can work on feature branches in their personal HAFS forks.

Background
----------

Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), as the Unified Forecast System (UFS) hurricane application, is the FV3 (FiniteÂ­ Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core) based multi-scale model and data assimilation system capable of providing tropical cyclone (TC, including hurricane and typhoon) analyses and forecasts of the inner core structure key to improving storm size and intensity predictions, as well as the large-scale environment that is known to influence the TC's motion. HAFS development targets an operational data assimilation and modeling system, capable of providing reliable, robust and skillful model guidances for TC track, intensity (including rapid intensification), size, structure, rainfall and cyclone genesis, as well as for TC associated storm surge, sea surface waves, and tornadoes. HAFS is a community-based coupled earth modeling system specially calibrated for hurricane prediction with TC dynamics and physics, sophisticated vortex initialization and advanced inner-core data assimilation techniques, and various air-sea interaction processes.

HAFSv2 will replace NCEP's current operational hurricane forecast systems, HAFSv1 in the 2024 hurricane season. The goal of this project is to upgrade the HAFSv1 that was running in operations in 2023. The system will provide improved and comparable tropical cyclone track and intensity forecast guidance in all global oceanic basins, as demonstrated through evaluation of retrospective and real time experiments compared against the two current configurations of operational HFSAv1 and HFSBv1.
