!C     Abstract
!C
!C     This subprogram solves a linearly constrained least squares
!C     problem.  Suppose there are given matrices E and A of
!C     respective dimensions ME by N and MA by N, and vectors F
!C     and B of respective lengths ME and MA.  This subroutine
!C     solves the problem
!C
!C               EX = F, (equations to be exactly satisfied)
!C
!C               AX = B, (equations to be approximately satisfied,
!C                        in the least squares sense)
!C
!C               subject to components L+1,...,N nonnegative
!C
!C     Any values ME.GE.0, MA.GE.0 and 0.LE. L .LE.N are permitted.
!C
!C     The problem is reposed as problem WNNLS
!C
!C               (WT*E)X = (WT*F)
!C               (   A)    (   B), (least squares)
!C               subject to components L+1,...,N nonnegative.
!C
!C     The subprogram chooses the heavy weight (or penalty parameter) WT.
!C
!C     The parameters for WNNLS are
!C
!C     INPUT..
!C
!C     W(*,*),MDW,  The array W(*,*) is double subscripted with first
!C     ME,MA,N,L    dimensioning parameter equal to MDW.  For this
!C                  discussion let us call M = ME + MA.  Then MDW
!C                  must satisfy MDW.GE.M.  The condition MDW.LT.M
!C                  is an error.
!C
!C                  The array W(*,*) contains the matrices and vectors
!C
!C                       (E  F)
!C                       (A  B)
!C
!C                  in rows and columns 1,...,M and 1,...,N+1
!C                  respectively.  Columns 1,...,L correspond to
!C                  unconstrained variables X(1),...,X(L).  The
!C                  remaining variables are constrained to be
!C                  nonnegative. The condition L.LT.0 or L.GT.N is
!C                  an error.
!C
!C     PRGOPT(*)    This real-valued array is the option vector.
!C                  If the user is satisfied with the nominal
!C                  subprogram features set
!C
!C                  PRGOPT(1)=1 (or PRGOPT(1)=1.0)
!C
!C                  Otherwise PRGOPT(*) is a linked list consisting of
!C                  groups of data of the following form
!C
!C                  LINK
!C                  KEY
!C                  DATA SET
!C
!C                  The parameters LINK and KEY are each one word.
!C                  The DATA SET can be comprised of several words.
!C                  The number of items depends on the value of KEY.
!C                  The value of LINK points to the first
!C                  entry of the next group of data within
!C                  PRGOPT(*).  The exception is when there are
!C                  no more options to change.  In that
!C                  case LINK=1 and the values KEY and DATA SET
!C                  are not referenced. The general layout of
!C                  PRGOPT(*) is as follows.
!C
!C               ...PRGOPT(1)=LINK1 (link to first entry of next group)
!C               .  PRGOPT(2)=KEY1 (key to the option change)
!C               .  PRGOPT(3)=DATA VALUE (data value for this change)
!C               .       .
!C               .       .
!C               .       .
!C               ...PRGOPT(LINK1)=LINK2 (link to the first entry of
!C               .                       next group)
!C               .  PRGOPT(LINK1+1)=KEY2 (key to the option change)
!C               .  PRGOPT(LINK1+2)=DATA VALUE
!C               ...     .
!C               .       .
!C               .       .
!C               ...PRGOPT(LINK)=1 (no more options to change)
!C
!C                  Values of LINK that are nonpositive are errors.
!C                  A value of LINK.GT.NLINK=100000 is also an error.
!C                  This helps prevent using invalid but positive
!C                  values of LINK that will probably extend
!C                  beyond the program limits of PRGOPT(*).
!C                  Unrecognized values of KEY are ignored.  The
!C                  order of the options is arbitrary and any number
!C                  of options can be changed with the following
!C                  restriction.  To prevent cycling in the
!C                  processing of the option array a count of the
!C                  number of options changed is maintained.
!C                  Whenever this count exceeds NOPT=1000 an error
!C                  message is printed and the subprogram returns.
!C
!C                  OPTIONS..
!C
!C                  KEY=6
!C                         Scale the nonzero columns of the
!C                  entire data matrix
!C                  (E)
!C                  (A)
!C                  to have length one. The DATA SET for
!C                  this option is a single value.  It must
!C                  be nonzero if unit length column scaling is
!C                  desired.
!C
!C                  KEY=7
!C                         Scale columns of the entire data matrix
!C                  (E)
!C                  (A)
!C                  with a user-provided diagonal matrix.
!C                  The DATA SET for this option consists
!C                  of the N diagonal scaling factors, one for
!C                  each matrix column.
!C
!C                  KEY=8
!C                         Change the rank determination tolerance from
!C                  the nominal value of SQRT(SRELPR).  This quantity
!C                  can be no smaller than SRELPR, The arithmetic-
!C                  storage precision.  The quantity used
!C                  here is internally restricted to be at
!C                  least SRELPR.  The DATA SET for this option
!C                  is the new tolerance.
!C
!C                  KEY=9
!C                         Change the blow-up parameter from the
!C                  nominal value of SQRT(SRELPR).  The reciprocal of
!C                  this parameter is used in rejecting solution
!C                  components as too large when a variable is
!C                  first brought into the active set.  Too large
!C                  means that the proposed component times the
!C                  reciprocal of the parameter is not less than
!C                  the ratio of the norms of the right-side
!C                  vector and the data matrix.
!C                  This parameter can be no smaller than SRELPR,
!C                  the arithmetic-storage precision.
!C
!C                  For example, suppose we want to provide
!C                  a diagonal matrix to scale the problem
!C                  matrix and change the tolerance used for
!C                  determining linear dependence of dropped col
!C                  vectors.  For these options the dimensions of
!C                  PRGOPT(*) must be at least N+6.  The FORTRAN
!C                  statements defining these options would
!C                  be as follows.
!C
!C                  PRGOPT(1)=N+3 (link to entry N+3 in PRGOPT(*))
!C                  PRGOPT(2)=7 (user-provided scaling key)
!C
!C                  CALL SCOPY(N,D,1,PRGOPT(3),1) (copy the N
!C                  scaling factors from a user array called D(*)
!C                  into PRGOPT(3)-PRGOPT(N+2))
!C
!C                  PRGOPT(N+3)=N+6 (link to entry N+6 of PRGOPT(*))
!C                  PRGOPT(N+4)=8 (linear dependence tolerance key)
!C                  PRGOPT(N+5)=... (new value of the tolerance)
!C
!C                  PRGOPT(N+6)=1 (no more options to change)
!C
!C
!C     IWORK(1),    The amounts of working storage actually allocated
!C     IWORK(2)     for the working arrays WORK(*) and IWORK(*),
!C                  respectively.  These quantities are compared with
!C                  the actual amounts of storage needed for WNNLS( ).
!C                  Insufficient storage allocated for either WORK(*)
!C                  or IWORK(*) is considered an error.  This feature
!C                  was included in WNNLS( ) because miscalculating
!C                  the storage formulas for WORK(*) and IWORK(*)
!C                  might very well lead to subtle and hard-to-find
!C                  execution errors.
!C
!C                  The length of WORK(*) must be at least
!C
!C                  LW = ME+MA+5*N
!C                  This test will not be made if IWORK(1).LE.0.
!C
!C                  The length of IWORK(*) must be at least
!C
!C                  LIW = ME+MA+N
!C                  This test will not be made if IWORK(2).LE.0.
!C
!C     OUTPUT..
!C
!C     X(*)         An array dimensioned at least N, which will
!C                  contain the N components of the solution vector
!C                  on output.
!C
!C     RNORM        The residual norm of the solution.  The value of
!C                  RNORM contains the residual vector length of the
!C                  equality constraints and least squares equations.
!C
!C     MODE         The value of MODE indicates the success or failure
!C                  of the subprogram.
!C
!C                  MODE = 0  Subprogram completed successfully.
!C
!C                       = 1  Max. number of iterations (equal to
!C                            3*(N-L)) exceeded. Nearly all problems
!C                            should complete in fewer than this
!C                            number of iterations. An approximate
!C                            solution and its corresponding residual
!C                            vector length are in X(*) and RNORM.
!C
!C                       = 2  Usage error occurred.  The offending
!C                            condition is noted with the error
