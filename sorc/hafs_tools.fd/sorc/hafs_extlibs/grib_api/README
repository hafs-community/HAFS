| IMPORTANT NOTICE |
+------------------+
Please note that 'ecCodes' is now the primary GRIB encoding/decoding package used at ECMWF.
Nevertheless GRIB API will be maintained and new releases made publicly available (until the end of 2018)
to support decoding of ECMWF model output.
Replacing GRIB API with ecCodes is expected to be transparent for current GRIB API users.
In particular the functions with the 'grib_' prefix are included in the ecCodes library.

Users are strongly advised to start the migration process.
Please note that GRIB-API support is being discontinued at the end of 2018.
