c     subroutine ivlapgs(nlat,nlon,ityp,nt,v,w,idvw,jdvw,br,bi,cr,ci,
c    +mdbc,ndbc,wvhsgs,lvhsgs,work,lwork,ierror)
c
c     given the vector spherical harmonic coefficients (br,bi,cr,ci)
c     precomputed by subroutine vhags for a vector field (vlap,wlap),
c     subroutine ivlapgs computes a vector field (v,w) whose vector
c     laplacian is (vlap,wlap).  v,vlap are the colatitudinal
c     components and w,wlap are the east longitudinal components of
c     the vectors.  (v,w) have the same symmetry or lack of symmetry
c     about the equator as (vlap,wlap).  the input parameters ityp,
c     nt,mdbc,ndbc must have the same values used by vhags to compute
c     br,bi,cr,ci for (vlap,wlap).
c
c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of points in the gaussian colatitude grid on the
c            full sphere. these lie in the interval (0,pi) and are computed
c            in radians in theta(1) <...< theta(nlat) by subroutine gaqd.
c            if nlat is odd the equator will be included as the grid point
c            theta((nlat+1)/2).  if nlat is even the equator will be
c            excluded as a grid point and will lie half way between
c            theta(nlat/2) and theta(nlat/2+1). nlat must be at least 3.
c            note: on the half sphere, the number of grid points in the
c            colatitudinal direction is nlat/2 if nlat is even or
c            (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct longitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater
c            than zero. the axisymmetric case corresponds to nlon=1.
c            the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c     ityp   this parameter should have the same value input to subroutine
c            vhags to compute the coefficients br,bi,cr, and ci for the
c            vector field (vlap,wlap).  ityp is set as follows:
c
c            = 0  no symmetries exist in (vlap,wlap) about the equator. (v,w)
c                 is computed and stored on the entire sphere in the arrays
c                 arrays v(i,j) and w(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c            = 1  no symmetries exist in (vlap,wlap) about the equator. (v,w)
c                 is computed and stored on the entire sphere in the arrays
c                 v(i,j) and w(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.  the
c                 vorticity of (vlap,wlap) is zero so the coefficients cr and
c                 ci are zero and are not used.  the vorticity of (v,w) is
c                 also zero.
c
c
c            = 2  no symmetries exist in (vlap,wlap) about the equator. (v,w)
c                 is computed and stored on the entire sphere in the arrays
c                 w(i,j) and v(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.  the
c                 divergence of (vlap,wlap) is zero so the coefficients br and
c                 bi are zero and are not used.  the divergence of (v,w) is
c                 also zero.
c
c            = 3  wlap is antisymmetric and vlap is symmetric about the
c                 equator. consequently w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric.
c                 (v,w) is computed and stored on the northern hemisphere
c                 only.  if nlat is odd, storage is in the arrays v(i,j),
c                 w(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat
c                 is even, storage is in the arrays v(i,j),w(i,j) for
c                 i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.

c                 equator. consequently w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric.

c                 i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.  the vorticity of (vlap,
c                 wlap) is zero so the coefficients cr,ci are zero and
c                 are not used. the vorticity of (v,w) is also zero.
c
c            = 5  wlap is antisymmetric and vlap is symmetric about the
c                 equator. consequently w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric.

c                 i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.  the divergence of (vlap,

c
c            = 7  wlap is symmetric and vlap is antisymmetric about the

c
c            = 8  wlap is symmetric and vlap is antisymmetric about the
c                 equator. consequently w is symmetric and v is antisymmetric.

c
c
c     nt     nt is the number of vector fields (vlap,wlap). some computational
c            efficiency is obtained for multiple fields.  in the program
c            that calls ivlapgs, the arrays v,w,br,bi,cr and ci can be
c            three dimensional corresponding to an indexed multiple vector
c            field.  in this case multiple vector synthesis will be performed
c            to compute the (v,w) for each field (vlap,wlap).  the third
c            index is the synthesis index which assumes the values k=1,...,nt.
c            for a single synthesis set nt=1.  the description of the
c            remaining parameters is simplified by assuming that nt=1 or
c            that all arrays are two dimensional.
c
c   idvw     the first dimension of the arrays w and v as it appears in
c            the program that calls ivlapgs.  if ityp=0,1, or 2  then idvw
c            must be at least nlat.  if ityp > 2 and nlat is even then idvw
c            must be at least nlat/2. if ityp > 2 and nlat is odd then idvw
c            must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c
c   jdvw     the second dimension of the arrays w and v as it appears in
c            the program that calls ivlapgs. jdvw must be at least nlon.
c
c
c   br,bi    two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c   cr,ci    that contain vector spherical harmonic coefficients of the
c            vector field (vlap,wlap) as computed by subroutine vhags.
c            br,bi,cr and ci must be computed by vhags prior to calling
c            ivlapgs.  if ityp=1,4, or 7 then cr,ci are not used and can
c            be dummy arguments.  if ityp=2,5, or 8 then br,bi are not
c            used and can be dummy arguments.
c
c    mdbc    the first dimension of the arrays br,bi,cr and ci as it
c            appears in the program that calls ivlapgs.  mdbc must be
c            at least min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c    ndbc    the second dimension of the arrays br,bi,cr and ci as it
c            appears in the program that calls ivlapgs. ndbc must be at
c            least nlat.
c
c    wvhsgs  an array which must be initialized by subroutine vhsgsi.
c            once initialized, wvhsgsi
c            can be used repeatedly by ivlapgs as long as nlat and nlon
c            remain unchanged.  wvhsgs must not be altered between calls
c            of ivlapgs.
c
c    lvhsgs  the dimension of the array wvhsgs as it appears in the
c            program that calls ivlapgs.  let
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and

c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or

c               lsavmin = (l1*l2*(nlat+nlat-l1+1))/2+nlon+15
c
c            then lvhsgs must be greater than or equal to lsavmin
c            (see ierror=9 below).
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls ivlapgs. define

c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            if ityp .le. 2 then
