c    subroutine vsurf is like subroutine hidel except the triangles
c    are categorized. vsurf is also like solid except triangles rather
c    than lines are covered.

c    this program plots visible lines for the surface defined
c    by the input 3-d triangles with corners at (x1,y1,z1), (x2,y2,z2)
c    and (x3,y3,z3). the sides of these these triangles may or
c    may not be plotted depending on itype. if itype is 1 then the
c    side between points (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) is plotted if it
c    is visible. if itype is 2 then the side between (x2,y2,z2)
c    and (x3,y3,z3) is plotted. if itype is 3 then the visible portion
c    of the side between (x3,y3,z3) and (x1,y1,z1) is plotted.
c    any combination is possible by specifying itype to be one
c    of the following values: 0,1,2,3,12,13,23,123.
c
c    the length of real    array  work must be at least 19*ntri
c
c    the length of integer array iwork must be at least 19*ntri
c
c
c    the vertices of the triangles are renumbered by vsurf so that
c    their projections are orientated counterclockwise. the user need
c    only be aware that the vertices may be renumbered by vsurf.
