c     given the scalar spherical harmonic coefficients ad,bd precomputed
c     by subroutine shaes for the scalar field divg and coefficients av,bv
c     precomputed by subroutine shaes for the scalar field vort, subroutine
c     idvtes computes a vector field (v,w) whose divergence is divg - pertbd
c     and whose vorticity is vort - pertbv.  w the is east longitude component
c     and v is the colatitudinal component of the velocity.  if nt=1 (see nt
c     below) pertrbd and pertbv are constants which must be subtracted from
c     divg and vort for (v,w) to exist (see the description of pertbd and
c     pertrbv below).  usually pertbd and pertbv are zero or small relative
c     to divg and vort.  w(i,j) and v(i,j) are the velocity components at

c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
c            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
c            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
c            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
c            grid point i=(nlat+1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
c            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
c            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
c            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
c            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater
c            than 3. the axisymmetric case corresponds to nlon=1.
c            the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c
c     isym   isym determines whether (v,w) are computed on the full or half
c            sphere as follows:
c
c      = 0
c            divg,vort are neither pairwise symmetric/antisymmetric nor
c            antisymmetric/symmetric about the equator as described for
c            isym = 1 or isym = 2  below.  in this case, the vector field
c            (v,w) is computed on the entire sphere.  i.e., in the arrays
c            w(i,j) and v(i,j) i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 1
c
c            divg is antisymmetric and vort is symmetric about the equator.
c            in this case w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the
c            equator.  w and v are computed on the northern hemisphere only.
c            if nlat is odd they are computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2
c            and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even they are computed for
c            i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 2
c
c            divg is symmetric and vort is antisymmetric about the equator.
c            in this case w is symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the
c            equator.  w and v are computed on the northern hemisphere only.
c            if nlat is odd they are computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2
c            and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even they are computed for
c            i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.

c     nt     in the program that calls idvtes, nt is the number of scalar
c            and vector fields.  some computational efficiency is obtained
c            for multiple fields.  the arrays ad,bd,av,bv,u, and v can be
c            three dimensional and pertbd,pertbv can be one dimensional
c            corresponding to indexed multiple arrays divg, vort.  in this
c            case, multiple synthesis will be performed to compute each
c            vector field.  the third index for ad,bd,av,bv,v,w and first
c            pertrbd,pertbv is the synthesis index which assumes the values
c            k=1,...,nt.  for a single synthesis set nt=1. the description of
c            remaining parameters is simplified by assuming that nt=1 or that
c            ad,bd,av,bv,v,w are two dimensional and pertbd,pertbv are
c            constants.
c

c            the program that calls idvtes. if isym = 0 then idvw
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
c            even then idvw must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
c            and nlat is odd then idvw must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c

c            that contain scalar spherical harmonic coefficients
c            of the vorticity array vort as computed by subroutine shaes.
c     ***    ad,bd,av,bv must be computed by shaes prior to calling idvtes.
c
c     mdab   the first dimension of the arrays ad,bd,av,bv as it appears
c            in the program that calls idvtes (and shaes). mdab must be at
c            least min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c     ndab   the second dimension of the arrays ad,bd,av,bv as it appears in
c            the program that calls idvtes (and shaes). ndab must be at
c            least nlat.
c
c  wvhses    an array which must be initialized by subroutine vhsesi.
c            wvhses can be used repeatedly by idvtes as long as nlon
c            and nlat remain unchanged.  wvhses must not be altered
c            between calls of idvtes.
c
c
c  lvhses    the dimension of the array wvhses as it appears in the
c            program that calls idvtes. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
c
c            then lvhses must be at least
c
c               (l1*l2*(nlat+nlat-l1+1))/2+nlon+15
c
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls idvtes. define
c
c               l2 = nlat/2                    if nlat is even or

c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2)       if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2)   if nlon is odd
c
c            if isym = 0 then lwork must be at least
c
c                       nlat*((2*nt+1)*nlon+4*nt*l1+1)
c
c            if isym = 1 or 2 then lwork must be at least

c     v,w   two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt) that
c           contain a vector field whose divergence is divg - pertbd and
c           whose vorticity is vort - pertbv.  w(i,j) is the east longitude
c           component and v(i,j) is the colatitudinal component of velocity
c           at the colatitude theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1) and longitude
c           lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c   pertbd  a nt dimensional array (see input parameter nt and assume nt=1
c           for the description that follows).  divg - pertbd is a scalar
c           field which can be the divergence of a vector field (v,w).
c           pertbd is related to the scalar harmonic coefficients ad,bd
c           of divg (computed by shaes) by the formula
c
c                pertbd = ad(1,1)/(2.*sqrt(2.))
c
c           an unperturbed divg can be the divergence of a vector field
c           only if ad(1,1) is zero.  if ad(1,1) is nonzero (flagged by
c           pertbd nonzero) then subtracting pertbd from divg yields a
c           scalar field for which ad(1,1) is zero.  usually pertbd is
c           zero or small relative to divg.
c
c   pertbv a nt dimensional array (see input parameter nt and assume nt=1
c           for the description that follows).  vort - pertbv is a scalar
c           field which can be the vorticity of a vector field (v,w).
c           pertbv is related to the scalar harmonic coefficients av,bv
c           of vort (computed by shaes) by the formula
c
c                pertbv = av(1,1)/(2.*sqrt(2.))
c
c           an unperturbed vort can be the vorticity of a vector field
c           only if av(1,1) is zero.  if av(1,1) is nonzero (flagged by
c           pertbv nonzero) then subtracting pertbv from vort yields a
c           scalar field for which av(1,1) is zero.  usually pertbv is
