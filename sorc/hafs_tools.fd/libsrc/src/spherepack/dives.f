c    +                 wshses,lshses,work,lwork,ierror)
c
c     given the vector spherical harmonic coefficients br and bi, precomputed
c     by subroutine vhaes for a vector field (v,w), subroutine dives
c     computes the divergence of the vector field in the scalar array dv.
c     dv(i,j) is the divergence at the colatitude
c
c            theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
c
c     and east longitude
c
c            lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon
c
c     on the sphere.  i.e.
c
c            dv(i,j) = 1/sint*[ d(sint*v(i,j))/dtheta + d(w(i,j))/dlambda ]
c
c     where sint = sin(theta(i)).  w is the east longitudinal and v
c     is the colatitudinal component of the vector field from which
c     br,bi were precomputed.  required associated legendre polynomials
c     are stored rather than recomputed as they are in subroutine divec.
c
c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
c            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
c            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
c            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
c            grid point i=(nlat+1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
c            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
c            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
c            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
c            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater than
c            3.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c
c     isym   a parameter which determines whether the divergence is
c            computed on the full or half sphere as follows:
c
c      = 0
c
c            the symmetries/antsymmetries described in isym=1,2 below
c            do not exist in (v,w) about the equator.  in this case the
c            divergence is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric about
c            the equator.  the divergence is computed on the entire
c            sphere.  i.e., in the array dv(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and
c            j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 1
c
c            w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the equator.
c            in this case the divergence is antisymmetyric about
c            the equator and is computed for the northern hemisphere
c            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the divergence is computed
c            in the array dv(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and for
c            j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even the divergence is computed
c            in the array dv(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 2
c            w is symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the equator
c            in this case the divergence is symmetyric about the
c            equator and is computed for the northern hemisphere
c            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the divergence is computed
c            in the array dv(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and for
c            j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even the divergence is computed
c            in the array dv(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c     nt     nt is the number of scalar and vector fields.  some
c            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields.
c            can be three dimensional corresponding to an indexed multiple
c            vector field.  in this case multiple scalar synthesis will
c            be performed to compute the divergence for each field.  the
c            third index is the synthesis index which assumes the values
c            k=1,...,nt.  for a single synthesis set nt = 1.  the
c            description of the remaining parameters is simplified by
c            assuming that nt=1 or that all the arrays are two dimensional.
c
c     idv    the first dimension of the array dv as it appears in
c            the program that calls dives. if isym = 0 then idv
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
c            even then idv must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
c            and nlat is odd then idv must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c
c     jdv    the second dimension of the array dv as it appears in
c            the program that calls dives. jdv must be at least nlon.
c
c     br,bi  two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c            that contain vector spherical harmonic coefficients
c            of the vector field (v,w) as computed by subroutine vhaes.
c     ***    br and bi must be computed by vhaes prior to calling
c            dives.
c
c     mdb    the first dimension of the arrays br and bi as it
c            appears in the program that calls dives. mdb must be at
c            least min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c     ndb    the second dimension of the arrays br and bi as it
c            appears in the program that calls dives. ndb must be at
c            least nlat.
c
c
c     wshses an array which must be initialized by subroutine shsesi
c            once initialized,
c            wshses can be used repeatedly by dives as long as nlon
c            and nlat remain unchanged.  wshses must not be altered
c            between calls of dives.  wdives is identical to the saved
c            work space initialized by subroutine shsesi and can be
c            set by calling that subroutine instead of divesi.
c
c
c     lshses the dimension of the array wshses as it appears in the
c            program that calls dives. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
c
c            then lshses must be at least
c
c              (l1*l2*(nlat+nlat-l1+1))/2+nlon+15
c
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls dives. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2                    if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2                if nlat is odd
c
c            if isym = 0 then lwork must be at least
c
c               nlat*((nt+1)*nlon+2*nt*l1+1)
c
c            if isym > 0 then lwork must be at least
