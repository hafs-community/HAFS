c

c
c     subroutine shsgc(nlat,nlon,isym,nt,g,idg,jdg,a,b,mdab,ndab,
c    +                 wshsgc,lshsgc,work,lwork,ierror)
c
c     subroutine shsgc performs the spherical harmonic synthesis
c     on the arrays a and b and stores the result in the array g.
c     the synthesis is performed on an equally spaced longitude grid
c     and a gaussian colatitude grid.  the associated legendre functions
c     are recomputed rather than stored as they are in subroutine
c     shsgs.  the synthesis is described below at output parameter
c     g.
c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of points in the gaussian colatitude grid on the
c            full sphere. these lie in the interval (0,pi) and are compu
c            in radians in theta(1),...,theta(nlat) by subroutine gaqd.
c            if nlat is odd the equator will be included as the grid poi
c            theta((nlat+1)/2).  if nlat is even the equator will be
c            excluded as a grid point and will lie half way between
c            theta(nlat/2) and theta(nlat/2+1). nlat must be at least 3.
c            note: on the half sphere, the number of grid points in the
c            colatitudinal direction is nlat/2 if nlat is even or
c            (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater
c            than or equal to 4. the efficiency of the computation is
c            improved when nlon is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c     isym   = 0  no symmetries exist about the equator. the synthesis
c                 is performed on the entire sphere.  i.e. on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.
c                 (see description of g below)
c
c            = 1  g is antisymmetric about the equator. the synthesis
c                 is performed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.
c                 if nlat is odd the synthesis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c                 if nlat is even the synthesis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c            = 2  g is symmetric about the equator. the synthesis is
c                 performed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.
c                 if nlat is odd the synthesis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c                 if nlat is even the synthesis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c     nt     the number of syntheses.  in the program that calls shsgc,
c            the arrays g,a and b can be three dimensional in which
c            case multiple synthesis will be performed.  the third
c            index is the synthesis index which assumes the values
c            k=1,...,nt.  for a single synthesis set nt=1. the
c            discription of the remaining parameters is simplified
c            by assuming that nt=1 or that the arrays g,a and b
c            have only two dimensions.
c
c     idg    the first dimension of the array g as it appears in the
c            program that calls shsgc. if isym equals zero then idg
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym is nonzero then idg must
c            be at least nlat/2 if nlat is even or at least (nlat+1)/2
c            if nlat is odd.
c
c     jdg    the second dimension of the array g as it appears in the
c            program that calls shsgc. jdg must be at least nlon.
c
c     mdab   the first dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears
c            in the program that calls shsgc. mdab must be at least
c            min0((nlon+2)/2,nlat) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0((nlon+1)/2,nlat) if nlon is odd
c
c     ndab   the second dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears
c            in the program that calls shsgc. ndab must be at least nlat
c
c     a,b    two or three dimensional arrays (see the input parameter
c            nt) that contain the coefficients in the spherical harmonic
c            expansion of g(i,j) given below at the definition of the
c            output parameter g.  a(m,n) and b(m,n) are defined for

c            mmax = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c     wshsgc an array which must be initialized by subroutine shsgci.
c            once initialized, wshsgc can be used repeatedly by shsgc
c            as long as nlat and nlon remain unchanged.  wshsgc must
c            not be altered between calls of shsgc.
