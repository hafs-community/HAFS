c     subroutine islapec(nlat,nlon,isym,nt,xlmbda,sf,ids,jds,a,b,
c    +mdab,ndab,wshsec,lshsec,work,lwork,pertrb,ierror)
c
c     islapec inverts the laplace or helmholz operator on an equally
c     spaced latitudinal grid using o(n**2) storage. given the
c     spherical harmonic coefficients a(m,n) and b(m,n) of the right
c     hand side slap(i,j), islapec computes a solution sf(i,j) to
c     the following helmhotz equation :
c
c           2                2
c     [d(sf(i,j))/dlambda /sint + d(sint*d(sf(i,j))/dtheta)/dtheta]/sint
c
c                   - xlmbda * sf(i,j) = slap(i,j)
c
c      where sf(i,j) is computed at colatitude
c
c                 theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
c
c            and longitude
c
c                 lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon
c
c            for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
c            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
c            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
c            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
c            grid point i=(nlat+1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
c            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
c            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
c            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
c            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct longitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater
c            than zero. the axisymmetric case corresponds to nlon=1.
c            the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c     isym   this parameter should have the same value input to subroutine
c            shaec to compute the coefficients a and b for the scalar field
c            slap.  isym is set as follows:
c
c            = 0  no symmetries exist in slap about the equator. scalar
c                 synthesis is used to compute sf on the entire sphere.
c                 i.e., in the array sf(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and
c                 j=1,...,nlon.
c
c           = 1  sf and slap are antisymmetric about the equator. the
c                synthesis used to compute sf is performed on the
c                northern hemisphere only.  if nlat is odd, sf(i,j) is
c                computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.  if
c                nlat is even, sf(i,j) is computed for i=1,...,nlat/2
c                and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c           = 2  sf and slap are symmetric about the equator. the
c                synthesis used to compute sf is performed on the
c                northern hemisphere only.  if nlat is odd, sf(i,j) is
c                computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.  if
c                nlat is even, sf(i,j) is computed for i=1,...,nlat/2
c                and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c   nt       the number of solutions. in the program that calls islapec
c            the arrays sf,a, and b can be three dimensional in which
c            case multiple solutions are computed. the third index
c            is the solution index with values k=1,...,nt.
c            for a single solution set nt=1. the description of the
c            remaining parameters is simplified by assuming that nt=1
c            and sf,a,b are two dimensional.
c
c   xlmbda   a one dimensional array with nt elements. if xlmbda is
c            is identically zero islapec solves poisson's equation.
c            if xlmbda > 0.0 islapec solves the helmholtz equation.
c            if xlmbda < 0.0 the nonfatal error flag ierror=-1 is
c            returned. negative xlambda could result in a division
c            by zero.
c
c   ids      the first dimension of the array sf as it appears in the
c            program that calls islapec.  if isym = 0 then ids must be at
c            least nlat.  if isym > 0 and nlat is even then ids must be
c            at least nlat/2. if isym > 0 and nlat is odd then ids must
c            be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c
c   jds      the second dimension of the array sf as it appears in the
c            program that calls islapec. jds must be at least nlon.
c
c
c   a,b      two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c            that contain scalar spherical harmonic coefficients
c            of the scalar field slap. a,b must be computed by shaec
c            prior to calling islapec.
c
c
c   mdab     the first dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears
c            in the program that calls islapec.  mdab must be at
c            least min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c   ndab     the second dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears
c            in the program that calls islapec. ndab must be at least
c            least nlat.
c
c            mdab,ndab should have the same values input to shaec to
c            compute the coefficients a and b.
c
c
c   wshsec   an array which must be initialized by subroutine shseci.
c            once initialized, wshsec can be used repeatedly by
c            islapec as long as nlat and nlon  remain unchanged.
c            wshsec must not be altered between calls of islapec.
c
c   lshsec   the dimension of the array wshsec as it appears in the
c            program that calls islapec.  let
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
c
c            then lsave must be greater than or equal to
c
c               2*nlat*l2+3*((l1-2)*(nlat+nlat-l1-1))/2+nlon+15
c
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls islapec. define
c
c               l2 = nlat/2                    if nlat is even or

c               lwkmin = nlat*(2*nt*nlon+max0(6*l2,nlon)+2*nt*l1+1).

c     output parameters
c
c
c    sf      two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c            that contain the solution to either the helmholtz 
c            (xlmbda>0.0) or poisson's equation. sf(i,j) is computed

c
c   pertrb  a one dimensional array with nt elements (see input 
c           parameter nt). in the discription that follows we assume 
c           that nt=1. if xlmbda > 0.0 then pertrb=0.0 is always 
c           returned because the helmholtz operator is invertible.
c           if xlmbda = 0.0 then a solution exists only if a(1,1)
c           is zero. islapec sets a(1,1) to zero. the resulting
c           solution sf(i,j) solves poisson's equation with

c           right side slap(i,j).
