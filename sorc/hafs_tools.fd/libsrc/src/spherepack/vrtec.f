c
c     given the vector spherical harmonic coefficients cr and ci, precomputed
c     by subroutine vhaec for a vector field (v,w), subroutine vrtec
c     computes the vorticity of the vector field in the scalar array
c     vt.  vt(i,j) is the vorticity at the colatitude
c
c            theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
c
c     and longitude
c
c            lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon
c
c     on the sphere.  i.e.,
c
c            vt(i,j) =  [-dv/dlambda + d(sint*w)/dtheta]/sint
c
c     where sint = sin(theta(i)).  w is the east longitudinal and v
c     is the colatitudinal component of the vector field from which
c     cr,ci were precomputed.  required associated legendre polynomials
c     are recomputed rather than stored as they are in subroutine vrtes.
c
c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
c            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
c            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
c            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
c            grid point i=(nlat+1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
c            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
c            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
c            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
c            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater
c            than 3. the axisymmetric case corresponds to nlon=1.
c            the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c
c     isym   a parameter which determines whether the vorticity is
c            computed on the full or half sphere as follows:
c
c      = 0
c            the symmetries/antsymmetries described in isym=1,2 below
c            do not exist in (v,w) about the equator.  in this case the
c            vorticity is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric about
c            the equator.  the vorticity is computed on the entire
c            sphere.  i.e., in the array vt(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and
c            j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 1
c            w is antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the equator.
c            in this case the vorticity is symmetyric about the
c            equator and is computed for the northern hemisphere
c            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the vorticity is computed
c            in the array vt(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and for
c            j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even the vorticity is computed
c            in the array vt(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 2
c            w is symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the equator
c            in this case the vorticity is antisymmetric about the
c            equator and is computed for the northern hemisphere
c            only.  i.e., if nlat is odd the vorticity is computed
c            in the array vt(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and for
c            j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even the vorticity is computed
c            in the array vt(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c      nt    nt is the number of scalar and vector fields.  some
c            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields.
c            in the program that calls vrtec, the arrays cr,ci, and vort
c            can be three dimensional corresponding to an indexed multiple
c            vector field.  in this case multiple scalar synthesis will
c            be performed to compute the vorticity for each field.  the
c            third index is the synthesis index which assumes the values
c            k=1,...,nt.  for a single synthesis set nt = 1.  the
c            description of the remaining parameters is simplified by
c            assuming that nt=1 or that all the arrays are two dimensional.
c
c     ivrt   the first dimension of the array vt as it appears in
c            the program that calls vrtec. if isym = 0 then ivrt
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
c            even then ivrt must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
c            and nlat is odd then ivrt must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c
c     jvrt   the second dimension of the array vt as it appears in
c            the program that calls vrtec. jvrt must be at least nlon.
c
c    cr,ci   two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c            that contain vector spherical harmonic coefficients
c            of the vector field (v,w) as computed by subroutine vhaec.
c     ***    cr and ci must be computed by vhaec prior to calling
c            vrtec.
c
c      mdc   the first dimension of the arrays cr and ci as it
c            appears in the program that calls vrtec. mdc must be at
c            least min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c      ndc   the second dimension of the arrays cr and ci as it
c            appears in the program that calls vrtec. ndc must be at
c            least nlat.
c
c   wshsec   an array which must be initialized by subroutine shseci.
c            once initialized,
c            wshsec can be used repeatedly by vrtec as long as nlon
c            and nlat remain unchanged.  wshsec must not be altered
c            between calls of vrtec
c
c   lshsec   the dimension of the array wshsec as it appears in the
c            program that calls vrtec. define

c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
c
c            then lshsec must be at least
c
c            2*nlat*l2+3*((l1-2)*(nlat+nlat-l1-1))/2+nlon+15
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c    lwork   the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls vrtec. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd.
c
c            if isym is zero then lwork must be at least
c
c               nlat*(nt*nlon+max0(3*l2,nlon)+2*nt*l1+1)
c
c            if isym is not zero then lwork must be at least
