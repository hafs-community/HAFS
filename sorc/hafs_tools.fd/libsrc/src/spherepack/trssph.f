c    +db,wsave,lsave,lsvmin,work,lwork,lwkmin,dwork,ldwork,ier)
c
c *** purpose
c
c     subroutine trssph transfers data given in array da on a grid on the
c     full sphere to data in array db on a grid on the full sphere.  the
c     grids on which da is given and db is generated can be specified
c     independently of each other (see description below and the arguments
c     igrida,igridb).  for transferring vector data on the sphere, use
c     subroutine trvsph.

c     notice that scalar and vector quantities are fundamentally different
c     on the sphere.  for example, vectors are discontinuous and multiple
c     valued at the poles.  scalars are continuous and single valued at the
c     poles. erroneous results would be produced if one attempted to transfer
c     vector fields between grids with subroutine trssph applied to each
c     component of the vector.
c
c
c *** underlying grid assumptions and a description
c
c     discussions with the ncar scd data support group and others indicate
c     there is no standard grid for storing observational or model generated
c     data on the sphere.  subroutine trssph was designed to handle most
c     cases likely to be encountered when moving data from one grid format
c     to another.
c
c     the grid on which da is given must be equally spaced in longitude
c     and either equally spaced or gaussian in latitude (or colatitude).
c     longitude, which can be either the first or second dimension of da,
c     subdivides [0,2pi) excluding the periodic point 2pi.  (co)latitude,
c     which can be the second or first dimension of da, has south
c     to north or north to south orientation with increasing subscript
c     value in da (see the argument igrida).
c
c     the grid on which db is generated must be equally spaced in longitude
c     and either equally spaced or gaussian in latitude (or colatitude).
c     longitude, which can be either the first or second dimension of db,
c     subdivides [0,2pi) excluding the periodic point 2pi.  (co)latitude,
c     which can be the second or first dimension of db, has south
c     to north or north to south orientation with increasing subscript
c     value in db (see the argument igridb).
c
c     let nlon be either nlona or nlonb (the number of grid points in
c     longitude.  the longitude grid subdivides [0,2pi) into nlon spaced
c     points
c
c          (j-1)*2.*pi/nlon  (j=1,...,nlon).
c
c     it is not necessary to communicate to subroutine trssph whether the
c     underlying grids are in latitude or colatitude.  it is only necessary
c     to communicate whether they run south to north or north to south with
c     increasing subscripts.  a brief discussion of latitude and colatitude
c     follows.  equally spaced latitude grids are assumed to subdivide
c     [-pi/2,pi/2] with the south pole at -pi/2 and north pole at pi/2.
c     equally spaced colatitude grids subdivide [0,pi] with the north pole
c     at 0 and south pole at pi.  equally spaced partitions on the sphere
c     include both poles.  gaussian latitude grids subdivide (-pi/2,pi/2)
c     and gaussian colatitude grids subdivide (0,pi).  gaussian grids do not
c     include the poles.  the gaussian grid points are uniquely determined by
c     the size of the partition.  they can be computed in colatitude in
c     (0,pi) (north to south) in double precision by the spherepack subroutine
c     gaqd.  let nlat be nlata or nlatb if either the da or db grid is
c     gaussian.  let
c
c        north pole                             south pole
c        ----------                             ----------
c           0.0    <  cth(1) < ... < cth(nlat)  <   pi
c
c
c     be nlat gaussian colatitude points in the interval (0,pi) and let
c
c        south pole                        north pole
c        ----------                        ----------
c           -pi/2  < th(1) < ... < th(nlat) < pi/2
c
c     be nlat gaussian latitude points in the open interval (-pi/2,pi/2).
c     these are related by
c
c          th(i) = -pi/2 + cth(i)  (i=1,...,nlat)
c
c     if the da or db grid is equally spaced in (co)latitude then
c
c          ctht(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
c                                               (i=1,...,nlat)
c          tht(i) = -pi/2 + (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
c
c     define the equally spaced (north to south) colatitude and (south to
c     north) latitude grids.
c
c
c *** method (simplified description)
c
c     for simplicity, assume da is a nlat by nlon data tabulation and da(i,j)
c     is the value at latitude theta(i) and longitude phi(j).  then
c     coefficients a(m,n) and b(m,n) can be determined so that da(i,j) is
c     approximated by the sum
c
c         l-1  n
c     (a) sum sum pbar(m,n,theta(i))*(a(m,n)*cos(m*phi(j)+b(m,n)*sin(m*phi(j))
c         n=0 m=0
c
c     here pbar(n,m,theta) are the normalized associated legendre functions
c     and l = min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2).  the determination of a(m,n) and b(m,n)
c     is called spherical harmonic analysis. a sum of this form can then be
c     used to regenerate the data in db on the new grid with the known
c     a(m,n) and b(m,n).  this is referred to spherical harmonic synthesis.
c     analysis and synthesis subroutines from the software package spherepack,
c     are used for these purposes.
c
c     if da or db is not in mathematical spherical coordinates then array
c     transposition and/or subscript reordering is used prior to harmonic
c     analysis and after harmonic synthesis.
c
c *** advantages
c
c     the use of surface spherical harmonics to transfer spherical grid data
c     has advantages over pointwise grid interpolation schemes on the sphere.
c     it is highly accurate.  if p(x,y,z) is any polynomial of degree n or
c     less in x,y,z cartesian coordinates which is restricted to the surface
c     of the sphere, then p is exactly represented by sums of the form (a)
c     whenever n = mino(nlat,nlon/2) (i.e., transfers with spherical harmonics
c     have n(th) order accuracy.  by way of contrast, bilinear interpolation
c     schemes are exact for polynomials of degree one.  bicubic interpolation
c     is exact only for polynomials of degree three or less.  the method
c     also produces a weighted least squares fit to the data in which waves
c     are resolved uniformly on the full sphere.  high frequencies, induced
c     by closeness of grid points near the poles (due to computational
c     or observational errors) are smoothed.  finally, the method is
c     consistent with methods used to generate data in numerical spectral
c     models based on spherical harmonics.  for more discussion of these and
c     related issues,  see the article: "on the spectral approximation of
c     discrete scalar and vector functions on the sphere," siam j. numer.

c
c *** comment
c
c     on a nlon by nlat or nlat by nlon grid (gaussian or equally spaced)
c     spherical harmonic analysis generates and synthesis utilizes
c     min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2)) by nlat coefficients.  consequently, for
c     da and db,  if either
c
c             min0(nlatb,(nlonb+2)/2) < min0(nlata,(nlona+2)/2)
c
c     or if
c
c             nlatb < nlata
c
c     then all the coefficients generated by an analysis of da cannot be used
c     in the synthesis which generates db.  in this case "information" can be
c     lost in generating db.  more precisely, information will be lost if the
c     analysis of da yields nonzero coefficients which are outside the bounds
c     determined by the db grid.  nevertheless, transference of values with
c     spherical harmonics will yield results consistent with grid resolution
c     and is highly accurate.
c
c
c *** input arguments
c
c ... intl
c
c     an initialization argument which should be zero on an initial call to
c     trssph.  intl should be one if trssph is being recalled and
c
c          igrida,nlona,nlata,igridb,nlonb,nlatb
c
c     have not changed from the previous call.  if any of these arguments
c     have changed, intl=0 must be used to avoid undetectable errors.  calls
c     with intl=1 bypass redundant computation and save time.  it can be used
c     when transferring multiple data sets with the same underlying grids.
c
c
c ... igrida
c
c     an integer vector dimensioned two which identifies the underlying grid
c     on the full sphere for the given data array da as follows:
c
c     igrida(1)
c
c     = -1
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for da is an equally spaced
c     partition of [-pi/2,pi/2] ( or [0,pi] ) including the poles which
c     runs north to south
c
c     = +1
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for da is an equally spaced
c     partition of [-pi/2,pi/2] ( or [0,pi] ) including the poles which
c     runs south to north
c
c     = -2
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for da is a gaussian partition
c     of (-pi/2,pi/2) ( or (0,pi) ) excluding the poles which runs north
c     to south
c
c     = +2
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for da is a gaussian partition
c     of (-pi/2,pi/2) ( or (0,pi) ) excluding the poles which runs south
c     north
c
c     igrida(2)
c
c     = 0 if the underlying grid for da is a nlona by nlata
c
c     = 1 if the underlying grid for da is a nlata by nlona
c
c
c ... nlona
c
c     the number of longitude points on the uniform grid which partitions
c     [0,2pi) for the given data array da.  nlona is also the first or second
c     dimension of da (see igrida(2)) in the program which calls trssph.
c     nlona determines the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlona. for
c     example nlona = 72 for a five degree grid.  nlona must be greater than
c     or equal to 4.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when
c     nlona is a product of small prime numbers
c
c ... nlata
c
c     the number of points in the latitude (or colatitude) grid
c     for the given data array da.  nlata is also the first or second
c     dimension of da (see igrida(2)) in the program which calls trssph.
c     if nlata is odd then the equator will be located at the (nlata+1)/2
c     gaussian grid point.  if nlata is even then the equator will be
c     located half way between the nlata/2 and nlata/2+1 grid points.
c
c *** note:
c     igrida(1)=-1 or igrida(1)=-2 and igrida(2)=1 corresponds to
c     the "usual" mathematical spherical coordinate system required
c     by most of the drivers in spherepack2.  igrida(1)=1 or igrida(1)=2
c     and igrida(2)=0 corresponds to the "usual" geophysical spherical
c     coordinate system.
c
c ... da
c
c     a two dimensional array that contains the data to be transferred.
c     da must be dimensioned nlona by nlata in the program calling trssph if
c     igrida(2) = 0.  da must be dimensioned nlata by nlona in the program
c     calling trssph if igrida(2) = 1.  if da is not properly dimensioned
c     and if the latitude (colatitude) values do not run south to north or
c     north to south as flagged by igrida(1) (this cannot be checked!) then
c     incorrect results will be produced.
c
c ... igridb
c
c     an integer vector dimensioned two which identifies the underlying grid
c     on the full sphere for the transformed data array db as follows:
c
c     igridb(1)
c
c     = -1
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for db is an equally spaced
c     partition of [-pi/2,pi/2] ( or [0,pi] ) including the poles which
c     north to south
c
c     = +1
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for db is an equally spaced
c     partition of [-pi/2,pi/2] ( or [0,pi] ) including the poles which
c     south to north
c
c     = -2
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for db is a gaussian partition
c     of (-pi/2,pi/2) ( or (0,pi) ) excluding the poles which runs north to
c     south
c
c     = +2
c     if the latitude (or colatitude) grid for db is a gaussian partition
c     of (-pi/2,pi/2) ( or (0,pi) ) excluding the poles which runs south to
c     north
c
c
c     igridb(2)
c
c     = 0 if the underlying grid for db is a nlonb by nlatb
c
c     = 1 if the underlying grid for db is a nlatb by nlonb
c
c
c ... nlonb
c
c     the number of longitude points on the uniform grid which partitions
c     [0,2pi) for the transformed data array db.  nlonb is also the first or
c     second dimension of db (see igridb(2)) in the program which calls
c     trssph.  nlonb determines the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlonb.
c     for example nlonb = 72 for a five degree grid.  nlonb must be greater
c     than or equal to 4.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when
c     nlonb is a product of small prime numbers
c
c ... nlatb
c
c     the number of points in the latitude (or colatitude) grid
c     for the transformed data array db.  nlatb is also the first or second
c     dimension of db (see igridb(2)) in the program which calls trssph.
c     if nlatb is odd then the equator will be located at the (nlatb+1)/2
c     gaussian grid point.  if nlatb is even then the equator will be
c     located half way between the nlatb/2 and nlatb/2+1 grid points.
c
c ... wsave
c
c     a saved work space array that can be utilized repeatedly by trssph
c     as long as the arguments nlata,nlona,nlatb,nlonb remain unchanged.
c     wsave is set by a intl=0 call to trssph.  wsave must not be altered
c     when trssph is being recalled with intl=1.
c
c ... lsave
c
c     the dimension of the work space wsave as it appears in the program
c     that calls trssph.  the minimum required value of lsave for the
c     current set of input arguments is set in the output argument lsvmin.
c     it can be determined by calling trssph with lsave=0 and printing lsvmin.
c     let
c
c          lwa =  2*nlata*la2+3*((la1-2)*(nlata+nlata-la1-1))/2+nlona+15
c
c     if the grid for da is equally spaced in (co)latitude.  let
c
c          lwa = nlata*(2*la2+3*la1-2)+3*la1*(1-la1)/2+nlona+15
c
c     if the grid for da is gaussian in (co)latitude.
c     let
c
c          lwb = nlatb*(2*lb2+3*lb1-2)+3*lb1*(1-lb1)/2+nlonb+15
c
c     if the grid for db is gaussian in (co)latitude.  let
c
c          lwb = 2*nlatb*lb2+3*((lb1-2)*(nlatb+nlatb-lb1-1))/2+nlonb+15
c
c     if the grid for db is equally spaced in (co)latitude.  then
c     the quantity
c
c          lwa + lwb
c
c     is the minimum required length of wsave.  this value is returned
c     in the output argument lsvmin even if lsave is to small (ierror=10)
c
c ... work
c
c     a real work array that does not have to be preserved
c
c ... lwork
c
c     the dimension of the array work as it appears in the program
c     calling trssph. the minimum required value of lwork for the current
c     set of input arguments is set in the output argument lwkmin.
c     it can be determined by calling trssph with lwork=0 and printing
c     lwkmin.  an estimate for lwork follows.  let nlat,nlon,l1,l2 be
c     defined by
c
c       nlat = max0(nlata,nlatb), nlon = nax0(nlona,nlonb),
c       l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2), l2 = (nlat+1)/2
c
c     then the quantity
c
c          nlat*(4*l1+nlon+2*nlat+4)+3*((l1-2)*2*(2*nlat-l1-1))/2
c
c     will suffice as a length for the unsaved work space.
c
c  *  both of the formulas above for lsave and lwork may overestimate the
c     required minimum values.  they can be predetermined by calling trssph
c     with lsave=lwork=0 and printout of lsvmin and lwkmin.
c
c ... dwork
c
c     a double precision work array that does not have to be preserved.
c
c ... ldwork
c
c     The length of dwork in the routine calling trssph.
c     Let
c
c       nlat = max0(nlata,nlatb)
c
c     ldwork must be at least nlat*(nlat+4)
c
c *** output arguments
c
c
c ... db
c
c     a two dimensional array that contains the transformed data.  db
c     must be dimensioned nlonb by nlatb in the program calling trssph if
c     igridb(2) = 0 or 1.  db must be dimensioned nlatb by nlonb in the
c     program calling trssph if igridb(2) = 1.  if db is not properly
c     dimensioned and if the latitude (colatitude) values do not run south
c     north or north to south as flagged by igrdb(1) (this cannot be checked!)
c     then incorrect results will be produced.
c
c ... lsvmin
c
c     the minimum length of the saved work space in wsave.
c     lsvmin is computed even if lsave < lsvmin (ier = 10).
c

c
c     the minimum length of the unsaved work space in work.
