c    +                 wshaes,lshaes,work,lwork,ierror)
c
c     subroutine shaes performs the spherical harmonic analysis
c     on the array g and stores the result in the arrays a and b.
c     the analysis is performed on an equally spaced grid.  the
c     associated legendre functions are stored rather than recomputed
c     as they are in subroutine shaec.  the analysis is described
c     below at output parameters a,b.

c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
c            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
c            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
c            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
c            grid point i=(nlat+1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
c            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
c            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
c            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
c            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater
c            than or equal to 4. the efficiency of the computation is
c            improved when nlon is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c     isym   = 0  no symmetries exist about the equator. the analysis
c                 is performed on the entire sphere.  i.e. on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and j=1,...,nlon.
c                 (see description of g below)
c
c            = 1  g is antisymmetric about the equator. the analysis
c                 is performed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.
c                 if nlat is odd the analysis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c                 if nlat is even the analysis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c            = 2  g is symmetric about the equator. the analysis is
c                 performed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.
c                 if nlat is odd the analysis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c                 if nlat is even the analysis is performed on the
c                 array g(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c     nt     the number of analyses.  in the program that calls shaes,
c            the arrays g,a and b can be three dimensional in which
c            case multiple analyses will be performed.  the third
c            index is the analysis index which assumes the values
c            k=1,...,nt.  for a single analysis set nt=1. the
c            discription of the remaining parameters is simplified
c            by assuming that nt=1 or that the arrays g,a and b
c            have only two dimensions.
c
c     g      a two or three dimensional array (see input parameter
c            nt) that contains the discrete function to be analyzed.
c            g(i,j) contains the value of the function at the colatitude
c            point theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1) and longitude point
c            phi(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon. the index ranges are defined
c            above at the input parameter isym.
c
c
c     idg    the first dimension of the array g as it appears in the
c            program that calls shaes.  if isym equals zero then idg
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym is nonzero then idg
c            must be at least nlat/2 if nlat is even or at least
c            (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     jdg    the second dimension of the array g as it appears in the
c            program that calls shaes.  jdg must be at least nlon.
c
c     mdab   the first dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears
c            in the program that calls shaes. mdab must be at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c     ndab   the second dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears
c            in the program that calls shaes. ndab must be at least nlat
c
c     wshaes an array which must be initialized by subroutine shaesi.
c            once initialized, wshaes can be used repeatedly by shaes
c            as long as nlon and nlat remain unchanged.  wshaes must
c            not be altered between calls of shaes.
c
c     lshaes the dimension of the array wshaes as it appears in the
c            program that calls shaes. define

c               (l1*l2*(nlat+nlat-l1+1))/2+nlon+15
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the

c
c            if isym is zero then lwork must be at least
