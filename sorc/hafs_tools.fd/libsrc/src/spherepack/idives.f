c
c     given the scalar spherical harmonic coefficients a and b, precomputed
c     by subroutine shaes for a scalar array dv, subroutine idives computes
c     an irrotational vector field (v,w) whose divergence is dv - pertrb.
c     w is the east longitude component and v is the colatitudinal component.
c     pertrb is a constant which must be subtracted from dv for (v,w) to
c     exist (see the description of pertrb below).  usually pertrb is zero
c     or small relative to dv.  the vorticity of (v,w), as computed by
c     vortes, is the zero scalar field.  i.e., v(i,j) and w(i,j) are the
c     velocity components at colatitude
c
c            theta(i) = (i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)

c
c     input parameters
c
c
c     nlat   the number of colatitudes on the full sphere including the
c            poles. for example, nlat = 37 for a five degree grid.
c            nlat determines the grid increment in colatitude as
c            pi/(nlat-1).  if nlat is odd the equator is located at
c            grid point i=(nlat+1)/2. if nlat is even the equator is
c            located half way between points i=nlat/2 and i=nlat/2+1.
c            nlat must be at least 3. note: on the half sphere, the
c            number of grid points in the colatitudinal direction is
c            nlat/2 if nlat is even or (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater than
c            3.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c
c     isym   this has the same value as the isym that was input to
c            subroutine shaes to compute the arrays a and b from the
c            scalar field dv.  isym determines whether (v,w) are
c            computed on the full or half sphere as follows:
c
c      = 0
c
c           dv is not symmetric about the equator. in this case
c           the vector field (v,w) is computed on the entire sphere.
c           i.e., in the arrays  v(i,j),w(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and
c           j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 1
c
c           dv is antisymmetric about the equator. in this case w is
c           antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the equator. w
c           and v are computed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.,
c           if nlat is odd they are computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2
c           and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even they are computed for
c           i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 2
c
c           dv is symmetric about the equator. in this case w is
c           symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the equator. w
c           and v are computed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.,
c           if nlat is odd they are computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2
c           and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even they are computed for
c           i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.

c
c     nt     nt is the number of divergence and vector fields.  some
c            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields.
c            the arrays a,b,v, and w can be three dimensional and pertrb
c            can be one dimensional corresponding to an indexed multiple
c            array dv.  in this case, multiple vector synthesis will be
c            performed to compute each vector field.  the third index for
c            a,b,v,w and first for pertrb is the synthesis index which
c            assumes the values k = 1,...,nt.  for a single synthesis set
c            nt = 1.  the description of the remaining parameters is
c            simplified by assuming that nt=1 or that a,b,v,w are two
c            dimensional and pertrb is a constant.
c
c     idvw   the first dimension of the arrays v,w as it appears in
c            the program that calls idives. if isym = 0 then idvw
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
c            even then idvw must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
c            and nlat is odd then idvw must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c
c     jdvw   the second dimension of the arrays v,w as it appears in
c            the program that calls idives. jdvw must be at least nlon.
c
c     a,b    two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c            that contain scalar spherical harmonic coefficients
c            of the divergence array dv as computed by subroutine shaes.
c     ***    a,b must be computed by shaes prior to calling idives.
c
c     mdab   the first dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears in
c            the program that calls idives (and shaes). mdab must be at
c            least min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c     ndab   the second dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears in
c            the program that calls idives (and shaes). ndab must be at
c            least nlat.
c
c
c  wvhses    an array which must be initialized by subroutine vhesesi.
c            once initialized,
c            wvhses can be used repeatedly by idives as long as nlon
c            and nlat remain unchanged.  wvhses must not be altered
c            between calls of idives.
c
c
c  lvhses    the dimension of the array wvhses as it appears in the
c            program that calls idives. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2        if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2    if nlat is odd
c
c            then lvhses must be at least
c
c               l1*l2*(nlat+nlat-l1+1)+nlon+15
c
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls idives. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2                  if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2              if nlat is odd
c
c            if isym = 0 then lwork must be at least
c
c               nlat*((2*nt+1)*nlon+2*nt*l1+1)
c
c            if isym = 1 or 2 then lwork must be at least

c
c     output parameters
c
c
c     v,w   two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt) that
c           contain an irrotational vector field whose divergence is
c           dv-pertrb at the colatitude point theta(i)=(i-1)*pi/(nlat-1)
c           and longitude point lambda(j)=(j-1)*2*pi/nlon.  w is the east
c           longitude component and v is the colatitudinal component.  the
c           indices for w and v are defined at the input parameter isym.
c           the curl or vorticity of (v,w) is the zero vector field.  note
c           that any nonzero vector field on the sphere will be multiple
c           valued at the poles [reference swarztrauber].
c
c   pertrb  a nt dimensional array (see input parameter nt and assume nt=1
c           for the description that follows).  dv - pertrb is a scalar
c           field which can be the divergence of a vector field (v,w).
c           pertrb is related to the scalar harmonic coefficients a,b
c           of dv (computed by shaes) by the formula
c
c                pertrb = a(1,1)/(2.*sqrt(2.))
c
c
c
c           the unperturbed scalar field dv can be the divergence of a
c           vector field only if a(1,1) is zero.  if a(1,1) is nonzero
c           (flagged by pertrb nonzero) then subtracting pertrb from
c           dv yields a scalar field for which a(1,1) is zero.
