README for HAFS build and install

Building HAFS is done by running the script "install_hafs.sh". It executes a
few other scripts to build HAFS binaries, install them at the "exec" folder of
the HAFS directory tree, link or copy the fixed files to the "fix" folder of
the HAFS directory tree, and copy the platform-specific configuration file.

Here is an example:
cd path/to/hafs/sorc
nohup ./install_hafs.sh [nco] > ./install_hafs.log 2>&1 &

Note: This step may take a while (30 minutes or longer).

The HAFS package currently uses the CMake build generator and GNU make build
tool. The build scripts create a new/fresh "build" folder to generate object
files after preprocessing and to link all object files and dependencies that
produce the executable. The HAFS build system supports Debug and Release build
types. The default build type is Release.

To build HAFS with DEBUG mode (if desired), one can update
path/to/hafs/sorc/build_all.sh from

export BUILD_MODE=${BUILD_MODE:-Release}   #|Release|Debug|
into
export BUILD_MODE=Debug
