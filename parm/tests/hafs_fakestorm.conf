# HAFS launcher requires vitals and a storm.
# This is a default minimum vitals file for a fake storm.
# The format of the missing value fields was based on the log
# output returned when running the launcher after the vitals have
# been "cleaned" up. That is, if  you enter the fields as all -999 values,
# the "cleaned" output is returned. In essence I'm treating the vitals
# module as a factory in the sense that it knows the correct format.
