# This is a UNIX conf file that overrrides WaterInTheWest.conf to run
# with 127 levels. Both the nest and parent have that many levels.

# This file must be after WaterInTheWest.conf in the run_hafs.py

# Do NOT use this for C768 if you want a full-length forecast. The
# WaterInTheWestL128C768.conf does that better.
