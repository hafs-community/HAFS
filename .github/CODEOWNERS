# Lines starting with '#' are comments.  
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.  

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo. 
# This can be made specific to each branch simply by designating different
# code owners in this file in different branches.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.  
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners  
# will be requested to review.  
#*.js    @octocat @github/js  

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.  
#docs/*  docs@example.com  

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs  
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its  
# subdirectories.  
# /build/logs/ @doctocat  

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like  
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like  
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.  
# docs/*  docs@example.com  

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory  
# anywhere in your repository.  
# apps/ @octocat  

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`  
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its  
# subdirectories.  
# /docs/ @doctocat
