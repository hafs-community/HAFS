TASK cleanup

PURPOSE: Deletes the HAFS hfsa or hfsb working directory left behind by the same
cycle yesterday.  This job saves a minute or so of runtime that used
to take up the beginning of the launch job.

TROBLESHOOTING:

PROBLEM: Job has hung?

This job should not take longer than 5 minutes; all it does is an "rm
-rf".  If the job takes more than 5 minutes, then it is likely that
there is a filesystem problem.
