FAMILY launch

PURPOSE: Creates initial directory structure and configures the rest of the
         workflow for one storm.

This launch family job creates the work area for one HAFS storm. It sets several
flags to turn on and off parts of the workflow, or disable the entire workflow
if there is no storm. All logic is triggered by the message file sent by the
SDM via setup_hurricane.

Labels:

  stormN - storm1-storm7 for HFSA; storm1-storm5 for HFSB; label tells whether
           a storm is to be run. IF the storm is to be run, it tells what the
           storm is, and who sent it (NHC or JTWC).

Events:

  NoStorm - set if no storm is to be run. The rest of the workflow sees
            the event and automatically completes via ecFlow completion clauses

  Ocean - for both HFSA and HFSB with ocean coupling

  Wave - for wave coupling (only HFSA will run it for NHC basin storms)

  Analysis - for both HFSA and HFSB will set it for NHC basin storms;
             for HFSA with JTWC storms, data assimilation is turned off

TROUBLESHOOTING

This job will rarely fail since it has little to do; it just sets up some
directories and makes configuration files. If this job fails, it is likely due
to a hardware or other system issue, with one exception...

PROBLEM: Why is there no storm?

The launcher does whatever the NOAA SDM tells it to do. The NOAA SDM uses a
script called setup_hurricane to create message files read by the launcher
job's JHAFS_LAUNCH script. If the launcher job decided not to run a storm, then
that means the SDM told it not to. If there should have been a storm, then it
likely means there was a communication problem, preventing data from getting
from NHC or JTWC to the NOAA SDM.

For NHC/CPHC storms, the NOAA SDM has a direct line to the on-call NHC/CPHC
person, who can confirm the absence of a storm. It may then be possible to
manually edit the message and nstorms files to add the storm in. Alternatively,
you could rerun setup_hurricane, but that may change storm priorities. In that
case, you must rerun the entire HAFS cycle (all storm slots). All of this is
technical possibility.  There may be procedural reasons why this cannot be
done.

For JTWC storms, the NOAA SDM has the direct line to the JTWC duty officer, but
there isn't much that can be done. JTWC lacks any way to send vitals after the
T+3 deadline. Hence, a JTWC storm that is missed, is missed.
